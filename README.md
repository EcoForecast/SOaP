## As of 2019/03/16

1. To generate the CHM data for each site, run the 5 r scripts starting with "Demo", then run the r script "ObtainingAndCalculatingTheLocatingUnitAreaOfEachPlot.R" and csv files "XXXX_Soilcore_CorrespondingMeanCHM_OfEachPlot_YYYY.csv" (XXXX=CPER/DSNY/HARV/OSBS/STER, YYYY=2013/2014) will generate.
2. To visualize the histograms of correponding mean Canopy Height Model (CHM) of each sitem run the r script "VisualizingMeanCHM_AllSites.R".

Note: 
1. CPER and STER only have 2013 data for CHM, and DSNY, HARV, OSBS only have 2014 data for CHM.
2. Running through 5 "Demo" scripts can take hours. 5 output csv files from r scripts starting with "Demo" are in advance generated and stored in the same folder with "XXXX_Soilcore_CorrespondingMeanCHM_OfEachPlot_YYYY.csv" that    is to be generated. One can directly run "ObtainingAndCalculatingTheLocatingUnitAreaOfEachPlot.R" to generate the 
"XXXX_Soilcore_CorrespondingMeanCHM_OfEachPlot_YYYY.csv" files.
